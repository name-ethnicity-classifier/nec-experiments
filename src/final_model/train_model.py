# DATASET CREATION:
#   - go into "preprocessing.py" and specify (in the "preprocess()" function call at the end of the file) which nationalities 
#     you want to use and what the name of the dataset should be

#   - run "python preprocessing.py", this will create a folder "datasets/preprocessed_datasets/<your-chosen-dataset-name>" in which
#     there are two files called "dataset.pickle" and "nationalities.json"


# TRAINING AND TESTING:

#   - in the config above change "model-name" to the name of this model/run/experiment 
#     (a descriptive name, e.g. "5_european_nat_and_else", it can also be the name as your dataset name)

#   - in the config above change "dataset-name" to the name of the dataset you want to use

#   - run (this file) "python train_model.py"

#   - when you break the training and want to start continue: copy the last learning-rate in the console (looks like this for example: "lr: 0.00095213")
#     and replace it with the first argument of "lr-schedule" in the config above, and set "resume" to "True"! 
#     (if you can't get the last learning-rate value you should start the training from the beginning)

#   - when you just want to test the model, comment out "train_setup.train()" and run this file

# train and test
train_setup = TrainSetup(model_config)
train_setup.train()
train_setup.test(print_amount=500, plot_confusion_matrix=True, plot_scores=True)
